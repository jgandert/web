# Tools Dashboard

A collection of lightweight, privacy-focused browser utilities that run entirely
client-side. No data ever leaves your machine — every tool works offline and
requires zero server interaction.

## Features

- **Various standalone tools** spanning data transformation, image manipulation,
  developer diagnostics, creative design, and productivity.
- **Unified design system** — all tools share
  [`one.css`](one_css/index.html), a class-lite semantic stylesheet providing
  consistent theming (including dark mode), typography, layout primitives, and
  iconography across every page. The only exception is "Recursive Grid JSON Editor"), as it has different requirements.
- **Single-file architecture** — each tool is a (nearly) self-contained `index.html`
  that can be opened directly in a browser with no build step.
- **Offline-ready** — everything runs in the browser; there is no backend.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser to reach the dashboard, then click
through to the tool you need. No installation, bundling, or dev server is
required.
